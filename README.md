### Note: This project draws inspiration from @ancod3r's TODO list application, serving as a practical endeavor to gain proficiency in the fundamentals of React.js, Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, MySQL, and Apollo Client. Its primary purpose is to provide a hands-on learning experience with React, allowing me to delve into the code independently.
